# PRAW - HAX Ecosystem Warp Rules

**PRAW** (Warp spelled backwards) is a repository containing comprehensive Warp AI agent rules for the HAX ecosystem. These rules codify years of development experience, best practices, and conventions to help Warp users work more effectively with HAX projects.

## What is this?

This repository contains:
- **`RULES.md`** - Centralized registry of all HAX ecosystem rules with unique IDs and categorization
- **`WARP.md`** files - Detailed context-specific rules for different project types
- **Rule Management System** - Scripts and tools for adding, searching, and managing rules
- **Cross-references** - Connections between rules and related documentation

These rules ensure consistency, quality, and proper integration across all HAX projects and web components.

## Quick Start - New to HAX?

**🚀 For complete newcomers**, we've created an automated onboarding script that sets up your entire HAX development environment with Warp optimization:

```bash
# Run the onboarding script from anywhere
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haxtheweb/praw/main/hax-onboarding.sh | bash

# Or if you've already cloned this repo:
cd ~/Documents/git/haxtheweb/praw
./hax-onboarding.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ Clone all necessary HAX ecosystem repositories
- ✅ Install and configure the HAX CLI (@haxtheweb/create)
- ✅ Set up Warp with HAX-specific rules and optimizations
- ✅ Create helpful development aliases and shortcuts
- ✅ Generate curated Warp agent prompts for HAX development
- ✅ Configure your development environment following HAX best practices

**Recommended for**: First-time contributors, developers new to HAX, or anyone wanting a fresh, optimized setup.

## Manual Setup - Existing HAX Developers

If you already have a HAX development environment and just want to add these rules:

### For Individual Projects

1. **Copy the main WARP.md** to your HAX project root:
   ```bash
   cp WARP.md /path/to/your/hax-project/
   ```

2. **Use specialized rules** by copying relevant subdirectory WARP.md files:
   ```bash
   cp webcomponents/WARP.md /path/to/your/project/elements/
   cp haxcms/WARP.md /path/to/your/haxcms-site/
   ```

### For the Entire HAX Ecosystem

If you're working across multiple HAX repositories, you can:

1. **Clone this repo** to your local HAX development area:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/git/haxtheweb/
   git clone https://github.com/haxtheweb/praw.git
   ```

2. **Symlink the main WARP.md** to your primary working directories:
   ```bash
   ln -s ~/Documents/git/haxtheweb/praw/WARP.md ~/Documents/git/haxtheweb/webcomponents/
   ```

3. **Let Warp automatically detect** the rules when working in HAX directories

## 🎓 Faculty Resource Management **NEW!**

**For non-technical faculty**: Create course resource repositories that AI agents use for grounded content generation.

### Quick Faculty Setup
```bash
# Set up a course resource folder
faculty-setup "Your Course Name"

# Add web resources
add-url-resource "Course Name" "https://example.com" "Description"

# Find course materials
find-course "Course Name"
```

### Faculty Workflow
1. **Setup**: Run one command to create course folder
2. **Add materials**: Drag-and-drop PDFs, docs, images
3. **Request content**: "Create a HAX site for [Course Name]"
4. **AI generates**: Grounded content using YOUR materials

**Benefits**: Zero technical knowledge required, natural language interface, authoritative content

## Contributing

This repository evolves with the HAX ecosystem. To contribute:

### Adding New Rules
1. **Use the management system**: `praw-add` for interactive rule creation
2. **Follow the categorization system** - choose appropriate category and provide context
3. **Test new rules** in your local development environment
4. **Validate structure**: `praw-validate` before committing

### Updating Existing Rules
1. **Locate the rule** using `praw-search` or `praw-list`
2. **Edit RULES.md directly** or use the management system
3. **Maintain rule precedence** - ensure changes align with precedence hierarchy
4. **Update related WARP.md files** if necessary

## Rule Precedence

When using these rules, Warp follows this precedence order:
1. **Subdirectory WARP.md** (most specific)
2. **Root project WARP.md** 
3. **Global Warp rules** (least specific)

This ensures project-specific needs take priority while maintaining ecosystem consistency.
