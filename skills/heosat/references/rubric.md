## 1. Legal & Licensing

Licensing clarity, copyright provenance, and reuse obligations.

### LL1 — The project is distributed with a clearly identified Open Source Initiative (OSI) Approved Open Source License ®.

An OSI-approved license is the legal foundation that tells users, contributors, institutions, and vendors what they may do with the software. The Open Source Definition <https://opensource.org/osd> and OSI Approved Licenses <https://opensource.org/licenses> provide trusted, reviewed standards for permissions to use, study, modify, and redistribute software.

Higher education perspective. Colleges and universities need licensing clarity for procurement, counsel review, technology transfer, research compliance, and downstream sharing with partners. Clear licensing lowers adoption friction for edtech and research software.

What good looks like. A mature project names the license on the website, in the repository, in package metadata, and in release artifacts, and avoids custom ambiguous terms.

**Evidence to look for:**

- LICENSE or COPYING file
- License named in README and website
- Package metadata includes license
- Release archives include the license

- [OSS Watch Openness Rating](https://oss-watch.ac.uk/apps/openness/)

### LL2 — Every repository and distributed artifact includes license and copyright notices.

Selecting a license is not enough; the license must travel with the code. Copyright and license notices preserve legal provenance when software is forked, mirrored, packaged, embedded, or redistributed.

Higher education perspective. Higher education projects often move between labs, grant teams, campuses, vendors, and foundations. Notices help future maintainers, counsel, and adopters understand rights and obligations after original staff or funding changes.

What good looks like. A mature project includes LICENSE/COPYING files, copyright statements, SPDX identifiers where appropriate, and license notices in release packages and documentation.

**Evidence to look for:**

- LICENSE/COPYING files in each repo
- Copyright headers or REUSE metadata
- SPDX identifiers
- Release artifacts contain notices

### LL3 — The project documents third-party dependencies and their licenses.

Open source projects inherit obligations from the libraries, frameworks, fonts, images, and build tools they use. Dependency license documentation prevents accidental incompatibility and makes reuse safer.

Higher education perspective. Campus IT and edtech procurement teams increasingly require software bills of materials, dependency inventories, and compliance evidence before adoption. This is especially important for projects distributed to multiple institutions.

What good looks like. A mature project maintains dependency manifests, reviews license compatibility, documents exceptions, and uses automated tools to detect changes.

**Evidence to look for:**

- Dependency manifest or SBOM
- Automated license scan results
- Policy for acceptable dependency licenses
- Review notes for major dependency changes

- [OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program](https://www.bestpractices.dev/)
- [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/)
- [REUSE Specification](https://reuse.software/spec/)

### LL4 — The project has a documented contributor licensing or contribution agreement policy.

Projects need to know that contributions can legally be included and redistributed. Contributor licensing policies clarify whether inbound contributions are accepted under the project license, a Developer Certificate of Origin, or a contributor agreement.

Higher education perspective. Universities may have employment, student work, grant, and technology transfer rules that affect contribution rights. A documented policy helps contributors and their institutions participate confidently.

What good looks like. A mature project states contribution licensing expectations in CONTRIBUTING.md, uses DCO or CLA processes only when needed, and avoids surprising contributors. A stated policy is a 2 (Documented); projects that also collect and track signed agreements from active and former contributors — the stricter bar some incubation programs (e.g. Apereo) require at exit — demonstrate the practice is actually followed and can score a 3 or higher.

**Evidence to look for:**

- CONTRIBUTING.md licensing section
- DCO/CLA records if used
- Pull request attestation process
- Institutional contribution guidance
- CLA/DCO signature bot records (e.g. EasyCLA, CLA Assistant logs)
- Roster or count of signed ICLAs/CCLAs/SGLAs, if used

- [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd)

### LL5 — The project explains trademark, name, logo, and brand usage expectations.

Licenses govern code, but project names, logos, and marks often have separate rules. Clear brand guidance prevents confusion about official releases, services, endorsements, and compatible distributions.

Higher education perspective. Edtech projects are frequently adopted by campuses and implemented by vendors. Trademark clarity helps institutions identify trusted sources while allowing a healthy service ecosystem.

What good looks like. A mature project documents acceptable use of names and logos, distinguishes community and vendor offerings, and explains how official releases are identified.

**Evidence to look for:**

- Trademark or brand policy
- Logo usage guidance
- Release authenticity guidance
- Vendor or partner listing criteria

## 2. Governance & Decision-Making

Transparent authority, participation, and project stewardship.

### GV1 — The project has a public governance model describing roles, authority, and decision-making processes.

Governance turns a code repository into a durable community. Clear roles and decision rules reduce uncertainty, prevent bottlenecks, and make it possible for new contributors to earn trust.

Higher education perspective. Higher education projects often span multiple institutions. Public governance helps campuses, funders, vendors, and contributors understand how priorities are set and how participation leads to influence.

What good looks like. A mature project publishes maintainership roles, voting or consensus rules, escalation paths, and processes for adding or retiring leaders.

**Evidence to look for:**

- Governance document
- Maintainer roster
- Decision records
- Documented role definitions

**Learn more:**

- [Producing Open Source Software](https://producingoss.com/)
- [Apereo Incubation](https://www.apereo.org/programs/software-incubation)
- [CHAOSS Metrics Models](https://chaoss.community/kb/metrics-models/)
- [OSS Watch Openness Rating](https://oss-watch.ac.uk/apps/openness/)

### GV2 — The project records significant technical and community decisions in public venues.

Public decision records create institutional memory and make project direction understandable to people who were not in the room. This supports transparency and continuity.

Higher education perspective. Academic and campus projects experience frequent staff, student, and funding turnover. Decision records reduce knowledge loss and help new institutional adopters evaluate project direction.

What good looks like. A mature project uses issue discussions, meeting notes, RFCs, architectural decision records, or mailing list archives for major decisions.

**Evidence to look for:**

- Meeting minutes
- Architecture decision records
- RFC or proposal process
- Public issue discussions

**Learn more:**

- [Producing Open Source Software](https://producingoss.com/)
- [CHAOSS Metrics Models](https://chaoss.community/kb/metrics-models/)
- [Apereo Incubation](https://www.apereo.org/programs/software-incubation)

### GV3 — The project has a defined process for adding, reviewing, and removing maintainers or committers.

Maintainer processes protect project quality while making leadership renewal possible. Without them, projects become dependent on informal personal networks.

Higher education perspective. Many higher education projects (even commercially supported) begin in or are adopted by one lab, an individual department, or a single campus. A transparent maintainer pathway helps them become multi-institutional assets rather than single-site projects.

What good looks like. A mature project explains eligibility, nomination, review, responsibilities, and offboarding for maintainers.

**Evidence to look for:**

- Maintainer policy
- Committer list
- Nomination or review records
- Offboarding process

**Learn more:**

- [Producing Open Source Software](https://producingoss.com/)
- [CHAOSS Metrics Models](https://chaoss.community/kb/metrics-models/)
- [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/)
- [Apereo Incubation](https://www.apereo.org/programs/software-incubation)

### GV4 — The project has policies for conflicts of interest, vendor participation, and institutional influence.

Open projects benefit from institutional and commercial participation, but unmanaged influence can erode trust. Conflict policies clarify how decisions remain community-serving.

Higher education perspective. Edtech ecosystems often include campuses, foundations, vendors, and funders. Clear participation rules help ensure that no single stakeholder can quietly capture project direction.

What good looks like. A mature project discloses affiliations, documents voting limits or recusal expectations, and treats vendor participation as welcome but transparent.

**Evidence to look for:**

- Conflict of interest policy
- Affiliation disclosures
- Vendor participation guidelines
- Meeting minutes showing recusals when needed

- [Producing Open Source Software](https://producingoss.com/)
- [CHAOSS Metrics Models](https://chaoss.community/kb/metrics-models/)

### GV5 — The project periodically reviews governance effectiveness and updates policies.

Governance that worked for a small founding team may not work for a multi-institutional community. Periodic review keeps authority, participation, and accountability aligned with project reality.

Higher education perspective. Universities and funders increasingly look for evidence that software communities can sustain themselves beyond a single grant or champion. Governance review demonstrates stewardship.

What good looks like. A mature project schedules governance reviews, invites community input, and publishes changes with rationale.

**Evidence to look for:**

- Governance review notes
- Community survey results
- Updated governance versions
- Board or steering committee minutes

**Learn more:**

- [Apereo Incubation](https://www.apereo.org/programs/software-incubation)
- [CHAOSS Metrics Models](https://chaoss.community/kb/metrics-models/)

### GV6 — The project documents and practices a standard voting procedure for decisions requiring formal approval.

Consensus works until it doesn't. A documented voting procedure (e.g., lazy consensus with a fallback to a majority or supermajority vote) gives a project a clear path to a decision when consensus stalls, and makes outcomes legitimate and auditable.

Higher education perspective. Apereo's Incubation Process requires incubating projects to adopt and demonstrate standard voting practices before graduation, since multi-institutional communities cannot rely on one maintainer's informal judgment call.

What good looks like. A mature project documents voting thresholds and eligible voters, and can point to at least one real vote on record, not just a hypothetical procedure.

**Evidence to look for:**

- Documented voting procedure and thresholds (majority, supermajority, lazy consensus)
- Defined quorum rules and eligible-voter roster
- Evidence of an actual vote on record (meeting minutes, mailing list, issue/PR)
- Escalation from stalled consensus to a formal vote

- [Producing Open Source Software](https://producingoss.com/)
- [CHAOSS Metrics Models](https://chaoss.community/kb/metrics-models/)

### GV7 — The project has an adopted, documented process for resolving community or governance disputes.

Disagreements over technical direction, roles, or conduct are normal in any community; what distinguishes a mature project is having an agreed path to resolve them rather than letting disputes fester or drive out contributors.

Higher education perspective. Apereo's Incubation Process requires an explicit conflict resolution policy, distinct from a conflict-of-interest policy, as an exit criterion — multi-institutional governance needs a known escalation path when participants disagree.

What good looks like. A mature project documents a dispute process with escalation steps (e.g., to mentors, a board, or a steering committee), distinguishes it from code-of-conduct incident response, and can show it has been invoked at least once.

**Evidence to look for:**

- Documented conflict/dispute resolution process
- Escalation path to mentors, board, or steering committee
- Evidence the process was invoked (meeting minutes, issue, decision record)
- Clear boundary between this process and code-of-conduct incident response

## 3. Community Engagement

Welcoming participation, communication, and community health.

### CE1 — The project identifies its target users, contributors, adopters, and stakeholder communities.

Community work is more effective when a project knows who it serves. Clear audience definitions guide documentation, roadmap choices, outreach, and support expectations.

Higher education perspective. Higher education edtech may serve faculty, students, instructional designers, registrars, researchers, accessibility staff, and IT teams. Naming these groups prevents the project from optimizing only for developers.

What good looks like. A mature project documents stakeholder groups and uses them to shape roadmap, support, and engagement practices.

**Evidence to look for:**

- Persona or stakeholder documentation
- Community strategy
- Adoption materials by audience
- Roadmap linked to user needs

- [CHAOSS Metrics Models](https://chaoss.community/kb/metrics-models/)
- [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/)

### CE2 — The project provides welcoming contribution pathways for non-code and code contributors.

Successful open source projects need more than code. Documentation, design, testing, accessibility review, translation, training, governance, and user support are all valuable contributions.

Higher education perspective. Higher education communities include many domain experts who may not be software developers. Recognizing non-code contribution invites faculty, librarians, students, instructional designers, and administrators into the project.

What good looks like. A mature project lists contribution types, labels beginner-friendly issues, and explains how contributors can help regardless of technical role.

**Evidence to look for:**

- CONTRIBUTING.md
- Good first issue labels
- Non-code contribution guide
- Contributor recognition records

- [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)

### CE4 — The project has a code of conduct and an incident response process.

A code of conduct sets expectations for respectful collaboration, but it is only meaningful when paired with reporting and response procedures. This supports psychological safety and community trust.

Higher education perspective. Higher education projects often include students, staff, faculty, vendors, and international participants with different power relationships. Clear conduct processes help institutions participate responsibly.

What good looks like. A mature project publishes conduct standards, reporting contacts, response procedures, and periodic maintainer training or review.

**Evidence to look for:**

- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- Reporting contacts
- Incident response process
- Moderator or maintainer training notes

- [Apereo Incubation](https://www.apereo.org/programs/software-incubation)

## 4. Documentation & Onboarding

Usable knowledge for adopters, users, administrators, and contributors.

### DO1 — The project has clear installation, configuration, and upgrade documentation.

Installation and upgrade documentation determine whether interested adopters can become successful users. Poor operational documentation creates hidden support burden and adoption risk.

Higher education perspective. Campus IT teams need to estimate effort, infrastructure, staffing, integration, and lifecycle costs before adopting edtech. Clear documentation supports responsible institutional decision-making.

What good looks like. A mature project provides tested install guides, configuration references, upgrade paths, and known limitations for supported environments.

**Evidence to look for:**

- Install guide
- Configuration reference
- Upgrade guide
- Supported platform matrix

### DO3 — The project documents contributor onboarding, development environment setup, and review workflows.

Contributor onboarding reduces the time between interest and useful participation. It also makes development practices consistent and easier to review.

Higher education perspective. Student workers, graduate assistants, campus developers, and vendor partners often contribute for limited periods. Strong onboarding preserves continuity despite turnover.

What good looks like. A mature project includes development setup, coding standards, tests, review expectations, and communication norms in a contributor guide.

**Evidence to look for:**

- CONTRIBUTING.md
- Developer setup guide
- Coding standards
- Pull request template

### DO4 — The project maintains architecture and integration documentation.

Architecture documentation helps contributors reason about the system and helps adopters assess fit, extensibility, and operational risk.

Higher education perspective. Edtech rarely stands alone. Campuses need to understand identity, LMS, SIS, data, analytics, accessibility, and privacy integrations before adoption.

What good looks like. A mature project documents major components, data flows, APIs, extension points, deployment models, and integration assumptions.

**Evidence to look for:**

- Architecture overview
- API documentation
- Integration guides
- Data flow diagrams

- [Sustaining Open Source Software in the Research Enterprise](https://sr.ithaka.org/publications/sustaining-open-source-software-in-the-research-enterprise/)

### DO5 — Documentation is maintained as part of the release and contribution process.

Documentation becomes unreliable when it is treated as separate from development. Keeping docs in the workflow ensures users and adopters receive accurate guidance.

Higher education perspective. Campus adoption decisions often depend on documentation accuracy. Out-of-date docs increase support costs and can create failed implementations.

What good looks like. A mature project reviews documentation changes with code changes, versions docs with releases, and assigns ownership for critical docs.

**Evidence to look for:**

- Documentation review checklist
- Docs included in PR process
- Versioned docs
- Release notes with documentation updates

## 6. Security & Risk Management

Vulnerability handling, supply chain risk, and operational trust.

### SR1 — The project has a documented security policy and private vulnerability reporting process.

Security issues require a safe way to report, coordinate, fix, and disclose vulnerabilities. A public-only bug process can expose users before fixes are available.

Higher education perspective. Edtech systems often handle student, employee, research, or identity data. Campuses need confidence that vulnerabilities can be reported and managed responsibly.

What good looks like. A mature project publishes SECURITY.md, reporting contacts, disclosure timelines, supported versions, and acknowledgement practices.

**Evidence to look for:**

- SECURITY.md
- Security contact
- Disclosure process
- Supported versions list
